# RRAS-2.0-A-Collective-Blended-Mechanism
Actually, most of businesses remain as failures due to lack of sufficient profits, lack of proper
improvement measures. Specifically, the restaurant owners are facing a lot of problems and
difficulties to improve their businesses due to lack of productivity in their business. To improve
their business, they should know drawbacks of their food items and improve them by taking
quality measures.
To resolve the problem of business loss which is due to drawbacks of food items, a solution is to
implement a “RESTAURANT REVIEW ANALYSIS SYSTEM USING COLLECTIVE
BLENDED MECHANISM”. Each food item in the restaurant is assessed through the text
review given by the customer where the text review is verified as a positive review or a negative
review by the implementation of collection of classification models (Collective ML Model) in
machine learning after handling textual data with natural language processing (to convert textual
data to numerical data). And this data is stored into the database where each food item consists
of number of customers, number of positive reviews, number of negative reviews, positive rate
and negative rate. Now, the owner checks the least positively rated food item from the database,
and takes necessary quality measurements which involve replacement of chefs or updation of
ingredients used etc.
